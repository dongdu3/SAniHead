### Install

#### sanihead_end2end 
This implementation has been tested on Ubuntu 18.04, using Python 2.7.12, TensorFlow-gpu 1.13.2, TFLearn 0.5.0, CUDA 10.0, etc.

To train the code, please install several external libraries.

1. Chamfer Distance  
Please make and replace the "cd_dist_so.so" file for the calculation of Chamfer distance. The source code and introduction can be found from [Pixel2Mesh](https://github.com/nywang16/Pixel2Mesh/tree/master/external). 

2. [DIRT](https://github.com/pmh47/dirt)  
Comparied with the source code of DIRT, we add the orthogonal projection function for our mesh rendering. The modified code can be found in [dirt](ui/Library/dirt). Please refer to [DIRT](https://github.com/pmh47/dirt) to install it. 

We also provide pre-trained models ([link](https://mailustceducn-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/dongdu_mail_ustc_edu_cn/EplJrKEahntMvynmR3KYavcB68f5aC5I_rQplLc3L4NFfg)) for the fine-tuning or testing. You can download them and put them in the directory of "sanihead_end2end".


#### ui
We design the user interface for real-time sketch-based animal-head modeling. It is built on Ubuntu 18.04, using Qt Creator 5.9.5.  The [ependencies](ui/dependencies.txt) are also given. To run the demo, a GPU with more than 8 GB memory is required.
